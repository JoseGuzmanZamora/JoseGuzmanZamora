### Hi! I'm Alejandro. I build minimalist apps.

- :video_game: I'm a Backend and Unity Game Developer working in Burlingame Studios :hibiscus:
- :rocket: As an #indiehacker Iâ€™m currently working on 'Nutrition Buddy' my new AI powered nutrition app!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter Development, focused on IOS
- :wink: I don't get excited about the tools, but about the products I can make with them
- :book: Learning is living
